# sentiment-analysis_mobile-operator
 Mobile operators are a big part of our daily life as we use their service for almost all of our communications nowadays. However, to know whether a particular mobile operator is satisfying their customer is difficult as the customers do not have a way to express their standings in a unified place. Furthermore, there are a lot of data that has to be analyzed. So we will create an interactive dashboard that will display the emotions of customers about their corresponding mobile operator. We will use an AI that will sort through the data of various social media platform. For example- operator Facebook pages, public Facebook groups, personal Facebook pages etc. The informal language of social media is the first thing to consider before performing text mining. The relationship strength between users can be guessed on the social sites using their interactions i.e. - wall posts, comments etc. by emotion analysis. We have used Na√Øve Bayes algorithm for getting our output. We will compare all the result that we get and figure out the best method to use to get the highest accuracy with our particular case.
